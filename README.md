# basic-calculator-using-HTML-CSS-JS
A basic calculator made using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is a simple yet functional web application that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Here's a brief description of the project:

Description:
This basic calculator is built using three main technologies:

HTML: The structure of the calculator, including the display screen and buttons for digits and operations, is created with HTML. It uses elements such as <div>, <button>, and <input> to build the layout.

CSS: The visual styling of the calculator is handled with CSS. It involves designing the buttons, display, and layout to ensure the interface is user-friendly and responsive. The CSS is used to control the size, colors, padding, borders, and font styles of various elements to make the calculator aesthetically appealing.

JavaScript: JavaScript is used to implement the functionality of the calculator. It manages user input, performs calculations, and updates the display. The script listens for button clicks, collects input from the user, evaluates mathematical expressions, and displays the result on the screen.

Features:
Basic Arithmetic Operations: The calculator supports simple operations such as addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).

Clear and Delete: It has buttons to clear the screen (C) or delete the last entered digit (‚Üê).

Responsive Design: The calculator is designed to work well on both desktop and mobile devices.

Real-Time Calculation: The result is updated in real time as the user clicks the buttons.

Code Flow:
HTML: Defines the layout with a display and buttons for digits and operators.

CSS: Styles the layout, ensuring a clean and attractive interface.

JavaScript: Handles user input, evaluates expressions, and updates the display dynamically.
